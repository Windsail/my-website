      	<h1>Introduction</h1>
      	<p>Hi. Thanks for visiting my test site. You're most likely me, so I think you know me pretty well. Or I guess as well as possible. How well can you really know someone, you know? "Haha! You handsome cad." <i>Oh, you...</i> "Oh, me!"</p>

      <section class="location-section">
      	<h1>Where I'm from</h1>
      	<p>Loaded question, really. I was born at Royal Infirmary, Leicester, U.K. My family's from India and Africa. However, I consider myself from Snellville, a burb of Atlanta, GA, where I've lived for the majority of the last 23 years <i>and</i> where I bought my first(!) house in 2015. <i>Love the South.</i></p>

      	<h1>More About Me</h1>
      	<h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
      	<p>I play guitar, illustrate for a living (and for fun), and love tech. I actually watch a LOT of tech videos (MKBHD, anyone?) and read a lot of tech-themed blogs/articles.</p>
      	<h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
      	<p>Have no idea, but it's a cross between working with my city and/or for Google. If I could somehow combine those, I'd be set.</p>
      	<h3>What else do you do?</h3>
      	<p>I raise two amazing boys; their mama left us a couple years ago, but we all still get along, I guess. The kids live with me. It's pretty awesome... and pretty tiring. I sometimes have an amazing girlfriend... sometimes... when she's not freaking out about us and disappearing for months at a time...</p>
      	<h3>Where would you like to retire?</h3>
      	<p>Sigh... I'm just trying to get over, honestly. The thought of retirement is terrifying right now. Gotta keep hustlin.</p>
        <h3>What music have you been listening to lately?</h3>
        <p>While working on this, a lot of Gem Club, Sean Carey, Low Roar, and Bon Iver. Chill, moody stuff. But in-between, tons of other stuff. A lot of Bowie and Motorhead (RIP/RIP), The Sword, Mastadon, Dinosaur Jr (<i>a lot</i> of DinoJr, actually), Superheaven, Radiohead, Silversun Pickups, DJ Shadow... it goes on and on. If any of that appeals to you (or if you'd like to hear something new), check out <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/peshy1942">my Spotify profile.</a></p>
